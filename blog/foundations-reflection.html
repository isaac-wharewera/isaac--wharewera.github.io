                <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
                <p>
                    In terms of the core we did I personally don't feel I learnt anything new things about myself. The core learning we did was often things I was already fimiliar with. I did find the aspects of sharing our personal lives/selves online 
                    to be a bit uncomfortable for me as I don't really engage with social media as a whole.

                <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
                <p>
                    We can recognise in ourselves the values we hold to help with our learning journey. Empathy is good for understanding how others feel about certain task when working in groups but can be a good form of understanding and reflecting on tasks
                    you've completed to know how you felt about it when reflecting. Self-awareness both helps with knowing when to be kind to yourself or push yourself, also helps with working with others and being 
                    aware of how you engage with them.

                <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
                <p>
                    Was just surprised at the amount of self-care we learnt thoughtout the foundations aspect of the course, I knew that there would be core learning but I expected there to be less.

                <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
                <p>
                    For me it was sharing what I learnt in the core learning exercises on my blog for everyone to read. I am someone you tends to keep personal experiences and the aspects of my live away from public environments or anything work related. 
                    In saying that thought if it is amoungst friends then I have no issues at all.

                <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
                <p>
                    I think that a lot of programmimg is problem solving which can be a tough task when you lack knowledge and are looking for solutions on your own, using what we have learnt in core helps us deal with these 
                    problems and by understanding ourselves we can keep our emotions in cheack and be kind to ourselves if we need. The core skills we learnt are also of high value to team based work environments as it is easy to help someone 
                    grow and for them to contribute if they are easier to work with and have a better understanding of how to work with others.

                <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer</h2>
                <p>
                    No. I believe understanding youself and what makes you tick is important to improving your life in many aspects, wether it be trying to achieve something new on your own or with other people. Having a high EQ benefits both you 
                    and the people around you.
