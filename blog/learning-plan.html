                </h2>
                <P>
                    I am hoping to get into a career where I can develope my coding skills further after Dev Academy. Could range from web design initially to big things as my knowlegde grows.  
                </P>
                <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have found just in the last 2 weeks of this course a strenght of my learning is once i have started working and am focused, I can continue to work happily for long periods of time. A limitation of this is that i struggle to get started or if i am pulled away from my work at any moment i struggle to get back into it. I aslo have limitation with making analogy for topics i have covered.
                    Another strenght is being honest with myself when it comes to setting goeals and what i need to work on more to progress.
                </p>
                <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My ability to work with others, I would like to improve in this aspect. Another limitation of my focus is i can be pulled out of it and be easily distrated by others.
                </p>
                <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
                </h2>
                <P>
                    How I will manage the work load from the course will be through allocating time and maintaining atleast 6hrs of time dedicated to my studies. Trying to be consistant with this time frame (eg. 9am-3pm) to create a habit/rhythm so it becomes consistant with everyday-life.
                    using the 6hrs of time wisely through taking a short time in the morning to set goals for the day and assessing the challenges I may encounter. Also being honest with myslef with expectation and limits. Using apps like Toggl Track helps with the time management. As to working with others listen to feedback offer help if i can, discuss ideas amongst each other to further help our understaning of topics.
                    If I become stuck at any moment break down the problem I am having, attempt to find a solution, if I cannot come to one in a timely matter reach out to outside sources for help (facilitators/cohort members).
                </P>
                <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To offer guidance if we have any problems with our learing after we have explored it on our own and have become stuck. Offer resources to current problems or challenges we are facing. Peferably not to give us the answer but help us to understand so we get the answer ourselves (not always possible).

                </p>
                <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Schedule planning is relatively easy. I have limited my commitments to invest more time into my studies. The commitments i do have take place in the weekend which takes 5hrs on a Saturday. Outside of that I do try to exercise daily which also needs to be factored into time scheduling.
