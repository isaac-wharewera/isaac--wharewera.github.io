                        <p>
                            I was having trouble with using a method called .map to look over a string(a set of text, eg 'this is a string').

                        <h4>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
                        <p>
                            I searched online about the .map method and found that it can't be used with string variables, I had to change the string variable into an array(eg turning the string into an array ['this', 'is', 'a', 'string']) to use the .map method. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                             I was in a good place between frustration and learning. Gave me a sense of achievement when I figured it all out, so the process was very rewarding.

                        <p>
                            .map can't be used with string variables until you change the string into an array.

                        <h4>what was the problem?</h4>
                        <p>
                            In our fizzbuzz task we had to write a function that would look through an array of numbers and on  numbers divisible by a certain value, return a word instead of that given numbers value. For example if we had the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and wanted everything divisible by 3 to get the value 'hello' we would expect the result to look like this [1, 2, 'hello', 4, 5, 'hello']
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
                        <p>
                            I used google to search for answers aswell as console.log() to check outcomes of codes I had written as potential solutions to my problem.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>how did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The inforamtion I needed was found easily so I felt this process went by smoothly. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>what did you learn?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Through this process I learnt how valuable using console.log() was to test all my code step by step before writting out the final function.

                        <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
                        <p>
                            Tried to implement it, needs a lot of work. I think as my coding knowledge expands I will understand how and what my functions need to do more easily so by effect my pseudocoding should get better.

                        <h4>Trying something</h4>
                        <p>
                            I tended to research my problem before I started to code my solutions so I wouldn't in a sense 'just try something'.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I would go over the problems in my head whlist going for a walk but wouldn't verbally go over them. Closest was rambling about it to my family.

                        <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
                        <p>
                            Error messages became extremely handy in the kata(teaching us new javaScript tech) exercise as it gave me small insights as to what I need to look up to get my code working. An example of this was when I tried to .map a string variable.

                        <h4>Console.logging</h4>
                        <p>
                            I found this to be the most useful of all. I could easily test code to see the outcome of said code. Was useful to test aspect of each code too, this helped my understanding of how things were working immensely.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Googling</h4>
                        <p>
                            Google is a means to have access to any information you need, so without explaination everyone should see the value in google. Used this for every task so far.

                        <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
                        <p>
                            I haven't reached out and asked my peers for help yet. I like to tackle things on my own first then if I find myself extremely stuck I will start reaching out for help. This will change depending on setting, if we do heavy group orientated work I like to solve and talk about problems as a group.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
                        <p>
                            I have reached out to my facilitator on a few occasions, mostly in reference to loops and will continue to do so as loops still haven't clicked for me just yet.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
                        <p>
                            Allowing more time to reflect is something I could do as I like to move onto the next task while I feel like my mind is focused and being productive. I do take time at the end of everyday to reflect over the problems I faced and the solution I came up with and how I could improve, but instead of going back and re-writing my code I make a note to implement my thoughts into future code so I can see the growth clearly.
