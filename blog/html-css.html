    <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
    </h1>

    <h2>The Basics
    </h2>

    <p>CSS uses something that is a "the box model" to tell web browsers how to display and space different elements on a web page. The boxes are made up of four major parts.
    </p>

    <p> These four components are called:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <h class="orange-text">Content</h>: The innermost part of the box. Content could be an image, text, heading, or something else. </li>
      <li> <h class="yellow-text">Padding</h>: The space between the content and the border the box.</li>
      <li> <h class="blue-text">Border</h>: The perimeter. can be invisible, thinkness can aslo be changed, aswell as color.</li>
      <li> <h class="White-text">Margin</h>: The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> What is the difference between a Margin and padding?
    </h2>

    <p>
      The main diference is between the two is that margin controls how much space/room exists outside of the box, while padding controls how much space/room exist with the box.

      They both are used to create space around certain elements but differ in the way they achieve it. Padding creates space by growing its own size or shrinking the content inside to take in the space. Margins creates space by pushing adjacent elements away or pulling them closer to the elemtent being adjusted. By default, padding will increase the size of the element to take in the space. But if you set “box-sizing: border-box” on the element, then it will shrink the size of the content inside the element to take in the gap.
    </p>

    <p>
      Padding can be set to zero pixels and above. It can change its own element's size and impact how much of a fill color or background image is visible within a box. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Margins, on the other hand, are essentially like invisible barriers around a box. They define how an element interacts with adjacent elements or the edge of a screen. Margins can be set to zero and above like padding. But unlike padding, margins can also be set to auto and can even have negative values.

    <h2>
      Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
      Borders are just a border that goes around the padding and content, that you can adjust/style to your liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Padding is the space that clears/adjusts the area around the content of the element.
    </p>
    <p>Margins is the space that clears/adjusts the area outside of the border which allows you to space elements accodingly or overlap them.
