                An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
            </h2>
            <P>
                HTML is responsible for WHAT is displayed. CSS is responsible for HOW it is displayed. JavaScript deals with interactivity (and also everything else).
    
                Only analogy I could think of was using a door. If the WHAT is the door, the HOW would be the color of the door and its design, JavaScript would be resposible for how the door functioned when interacted with(opening/closing) and any other ways you could think of interacting with the door.

                    Control Flow: The technical term for specifying the sequence in which a code executes.

                    Conflow Flow is like the sequential steps you have to follow on a recipe when baking a cake.</li>
                <li>
                    Loops: Used to repeat a block of code. Offers a quick and easy way to do SOMETHING repeatedly. An example of this would be if you set out to preform 1 push-up that would be considered the SOMETHING we did. We can use loops to repeat that SOMETHING 100 times, effectively making us do 100 push-ups.

                Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
            </h2>
            <P>
                The DOM is a tree-like representation of the web page that gets loaded into the browser. It represents the web page using a series of objects. The main object is the document object, which in turn houses other objects which also house their own objects, and so on. Those objects are usually refered to as nodes. 

            
                A way to interact with it is by using the JavaScript API to modify or change the HTML document.

                Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
            </h2>
            <P>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To access data from arrays you must either access it through its binding i value(value[i]) or with its own value or name. An example if we had the array [2, 3, 7, 4, 9] to access the fist data in the array we would use value[0] or value["2"].
                    </li>
                    <div>
                        <img src="" alt="will be a image">
                    </div>
                    <li>
                        To access objects we use something called "dot property accessor" which is a common way to access the properties of an object. An example is if we have a object with the value (tree) and  a property with the value( branches: 'big'). We can access this property by using "dot property accessor" which looks like this: tree.branches.
                    </li>

            <h2>
                Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.
            </h2>
            <P>
                Functions are a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it). They are helpful because functions allow you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want. So if you create an Element that later needs to perform an already existing function instead of duplicating or re-writting code you can just call the function.
