            </h2>
            <p>
                The brain is just like any other muscle in your body if you understand its function and create a proper way to train the selected muscle group you will see benefits and growth.
                Neuroplasticity is the brains ability to modify its connections or to re-write itself. Understanding this and how it works can provide huge success when learning about new information or trying to pick
                up a new skill, like playing an instrument. It was once believed that as we aged, the brain's networks became fixed. In the past two decades, however, an enormous amount of research has revealed that the brain never stops changing and adjusting.

                Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity lets us understand how the brain strengthens and creates connection between the neurons in our brain. Applying techniques that revolve around neuroplasticity to our learning will help create an overall better understanding and also quicken the learning experience and strengthen information retention.

                What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
            </h2>
            <p>
                One the simplest ways would be repetition. Repeating a exercise or motion uses the same pathways in your brain repeatedly, which results in the pathway growing more robust.
                There are many other ways to increase neuroplasticity the link here will provide the info. <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/neuroplasticity-train-your-brain">Ways to increase neuroplasticity.</a>

                Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
            </h2>
            <p>
                A growth mindset means believing that your abilities and successes can improve with continued resilience, effort, and learning. It's relevant because it means everyone is capable of growth if we are willing to persist and nothing is predetermined in terms of ones learning ability. A growth mindset drives motivation and achievement. Failure meet with a growth mindset is seen as a oppurtunity to push oneself to grow.
            </p>
            <p>
                A contrast to this would be a fixed mindset, where it is thought that we all have predetermined limits. Failure meet with a fixed mindset is seen as ones limit to their knowledge or skill.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Nothing changed for me, a lot of people I take influence from push the growth mindset model in one way or another. I was surprised to see that just knowing about a growth mindset caused students to succeed more than those who didn't.
