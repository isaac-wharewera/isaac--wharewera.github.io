        My name is Isaac, I am part of the wellington cohort, will hopefully be part of the boot camp when that starts up assuming foundations goes well.
        I am currently living it Lower-Hutt which is part of the Wellington region.

        After overthinking the section about identity and values I don't have to much share, but hope to further understand myself as this course progresses.
        Asking a few people that know me well and the help of the tools, honesty is a high value of mine.

        I find myself in a position where I want to pursue a career and now have the time to invest into that goal.
        I have a few family members that have done some coding and web design and it caught my interest. I haven't personally done too much in the way
        of coding myself but am eager to learn.

        Looking forward to working with you all.
