                What is Emotional Intelligence?
            </h2>
            <P>
                Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to perceive, interpret, demonstrate, control, evaluate, and use emotions to communicate with and relate to others effectively and constructively.

            <h2>
                How is EQ different to IQ?
            </h2>
            <P>
                The main difference between IQ and EQ is that IQ is a measure of someone’s reasoning ability, while EQ is the ability to perceive, evaluate and control emotions.

                IQ and EQ are two terms that are commonly confused and misused. These are two different measures. IQ stands for intelligence quotient, while EQ stands for emotional quotient. We consider IQ as an estimate of a person’s intelligence, but we consider EQ as a person’s ability to understand and manage emotions.
            </P>
            <h2>
                Why is EQ important?
            </h2>
            <P>
                A high EQ helps you to build relationships, reduce team stress, defuse conflict and improve job satisfaction. A person with high EQ can communicate better, lessen their anxiety and stress, resolve conflicts, improve relationships, empathize with others, and overcome life's challenges. People with higher levels of emotional intelligence can check on their emotions better and be empathetic to others around them. 
            </P>
