            <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now
            </h2>
            <P>
                I referee basketball for College Sport Wellington, various other tournaments and local comps where I am faced with the responsibility of remaining neutral and unbias no matter my relationship with others involved or situations that may occur. In sport as a referee many situation and calls come into play and reflecting on them afterward is what helps you grow as a ref. 
            </P>
            <h2>
                Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity
            </h2>
            <p>
                Two people have influenced my values greatly. First would be my mother who taught me to be strong, stand up for what I believe in and to never give up. The second my aunty who taught me kindness, love and to be considerate of others.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey
            </h2>
            <p>
                My strengths are honesty, careful judgement and persistance.
                <ul>
                    <li>Honesty: Being honest with myself to further my understanding of what I need to work on to help. Also being honest to others in regards to feedback</li>
                    <li>Careful Judgement: Can be applied to understand where I went wrong, or to make a good intial plan to follow. Also helps with being open to eternal feedback or help.</li>
                    <li>Persistance: Don't give up mentality, helps me push on when I have trouble.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>
                Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Myself and time are my biggest limitation. I tend to procrastinate and not manage my time well. I also prefer to work under pressure so when I see the end is nearing and the pressure is off I will slow down my output of work.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why
            </h2>
            <p>
                Coaching sport and understanding the potential players have but due to their lack of self-belief and confidence creates resistance between their current state and me helping them work towards their potential. My knowledge of the sport, through years of
                experience allowed me to see how effective a simple action or change to a position could work for the players. Thus giving them a sense of accomplishment and a drive to try new things. Each individual is different some enjoy being pushed beyond their limits others don't like to leave their comfort zones.
                Understanding how people respond to certain situations helps evaluate what the best action to take is. So it varies from player to player. Also people like to celebrate their progression differently, some liked to be praised others are content with just knowing they did a good job. Coaching requires you to constantly reflect on your approach 
                and the strategies you employ to provide the best experience for your players.
